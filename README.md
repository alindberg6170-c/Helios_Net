# Helios Network: A DePIN for Solar Energy with a DeFi Lending Pool

Helios Network is a decentralized solar energy grid that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to provide a secure platform for users to encrypt their energy production data and use it as collateral within a DeFi lending pool. By integrating advanced privacy-preserving techniques with decentralized finance, Helios Network enables users to access loans while safeguarding their sensitive information. 

## Tackling the Energy Financing Dilemma

The world is facing an urgent need for sustainable energy solutions, yet many renewable energy projects struggle to secure financing due to the lack of transparent, verifiable data on their energy outputs. Consumers and developers often find themselves in a precarious position; they want to harness the benefits of solar energy but are hindered by the challenge of obtaining loans without presenting sensitive business information. This project addresses these concerns by creating a secure environment where energy production data can be confidentially shared and utilized for accessing DeFi lending pools.

## How FHE Transforms Energy Financing

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** enables computations to be performed on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. This revolutionary approach permits Helios Network to execute financial risk models on encrypted future energy outputs, ensuring privacy and security. By employing Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, the project provides robust data protection while facilitating lending processes. This means that users can pledge their anticipated solar energy production as collateral for loans, all while maintaining data confidentiality, creating a trustless ecosystem governed by smart contracts.

## Core Functionalities of Helios Network

- **Encrypted Solar Data Upload:** Users can securely upload their solar energy generation data using FHE, ensuring complete privacy.
- **Collateralization of Future Energy Production:** The network allows users to leverage their projected energy output as collateral for obtaining loans from a decentralized lending pool.
- **Homomorphic Risk Assessment:** Financial risk models are executed on encrypted data, allowing for accurate risk assessment without compromising user privacy.
- **DAO Governance:** Network upgrades and rewards are managed through private voting within a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), aligning incentives with the community.
- **Geographical Information System (GIS) Integration:** Enhanced visualization and analytics of solar energy production data, bridging DeFi and renewable energy insights.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK:** The cornerstone for implementing secure, confidential computing.
- **Solidity:** For smart contract development.
- **Node.js:** For backend services.
- **Hardhat/Foundry:** Development framework for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **MongoDB:** To store user data and transaction history securely.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **Hardhat** (for smart contract deployment and testing)

Once you have the necessary software, follow these steps to set up Helios Network:

1. Navigate to the project directory on your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries.

**Important:** Do not use `git clone` or any URLs to download the project. Follow the instructions provided carefully.

## Compiling, Testing, and Running

To get Helios Network up and running, follow these commands in your terminal:

1. **Compile Contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy Contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

4. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a brief code snippet demonstrating how a user can upload their solar energy production data securely:

```javascript
const { encryptData, uploadData } = require('./services/encryption');

// User's solar energy production data
const solarData = {
  userId: 'user123',
  energyOutput: 5000 // in kWh
};

async function submitSolarData() {
  const encryptedData = await encryptData(solarData);
  const result = await uploadData(encryptedData);
  console.log('Data uploaded successfully:', result);
}

submitSolarData();
```

This code showcases how to securely encrypt and upload solar energy production data, making it ready for the lending pool.
